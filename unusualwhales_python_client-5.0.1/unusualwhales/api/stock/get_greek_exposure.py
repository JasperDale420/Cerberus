    """Greek Exposure

     Greek Exposure is the assumed greek exposure that market makers are exposed to. The most popular
    greek exposure is gamma exposure (GEX).

    Investors and large funds lower risk and protect their money by selling calls and buying puts.
    Market makers provide the liquidity to facilitate these trades. GEX assumes that market makers are
    part of every transaction and that the bulk of their transactions are buying calls and selling puts
    to investors hedging their portfolios. If a market maker has one contract open with a gamma value of
    0.05, then that market maker is exposed to 0.05 * [100 shares] of gamma. The total market maker
    exposure is calculated by summing up the exposure values of all open contracts determined by the
    daily open interest. Market makers profit from the bid-ask spreads and as such, they constantly
    gamma hedge (they buy and sell shares to keep their positions delta neutral).

    Long call positions are positive gamma - as the stock price increases and delta rises (approaches
    1), market makers hedge by selling shares, and they buy shares if the stock price decreases and
    delta falls.

    Short put positions are negative gamma - as the stock price increases and delta falls (approaches
    -1), market makers hedge by buying shares, and they sell shares if the stock price decreases and
    delta rises.

    As such, in the event of large positive gamma, volatility is suppressed as market makers will hedge
    by buying as the stock price decreases and selling as the stock price increases. And in the event of
    large negative gamma, volatility is amplified as market makers will hedge by buying as the stock
    price increases and selling as the stock price decreases.
