    """Spot GEX exposures by strike

     Returns the most recent spot GEX exposures across all strikes for the given ticker on a given date.
    Calculated either with open interest or with volume.

    Spot GEX is the assumed $ value of the given greek (ie. gamma) exposure that market makers need to
    hedge per 1% change of the underlying stock's price movement. A positive value is long and a
    negative value is short.

    Investors and large funds lower risk and protect their money by selling calls and buying puts.
    Market makers provide the liquidity to facilitate these trades.

    GEX assumes that market makers are part of every transaction and that the bulk of their transactions
    are buying calls and selling puts to investors hedging their portfolios.

    If a market maker has one contract open with a gamma value of 0.05, then if the underlying stock
    price moves by 1%, that market maker is exposed to $[0.05 * 100 shares * 0.01 * stock price *
    underlying parameter of the greek variable (for gamma this variable is the stock price)]. The total
    market maker spot exposure is calculated by summing up the spot exposure of all open contracts
    determined by the daily open interest or by volume.

    Market makers profit from the bid-ask spreads and as such, they constantly gamma hedge (they buy and
    sell shares to keep their positions delta neutral).

    Long call positions are positive gamma - as the stock price increases and delta rises (approaches
    1), market makers hedge by selling shares, and they buy shares if the stock price decreases and
    delta falls.

    Short put positions are negative gamma - as the stock price increases and delta falls (approaches
    -1), market makers hedge by buying shares, and they sell shares if the stock price decreases and
    delta rises.

    As such, in the event of large positive gamma, volatility is suppressed as market makers will hedge
    by buying as the stock price decreases and selling as the stock price increases. And in the event of
    large negative gamma, volatility is amplified as market makers will hedge by buying as the stock
    price increases and selling as the stock price decreases.
