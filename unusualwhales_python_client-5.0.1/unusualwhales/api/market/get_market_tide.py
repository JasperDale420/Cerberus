    """Returns The Unusual Whales Market Tide Data

     Market Tide is a proprietary tool that can be viewed from the Market Overview page. The Market Tide
    chart provides real time data based on a proprietary formula that examines market wide options
    activity and filters out 'noise'.

    Date must be the current or a past date. If no date is given, returns data for the current/last
    market day.

    Per default data are returned in 1 minute intervals. Use `interval_5m=true` to have this return data
    in 5 minute intervals instead.


    for example
    - $15,000 in calls transacted at the ask has the effect of increasing the daily net call premium by
    $15,000.
    - $10,000 in calls transacted at the bid has the effect of decreasing the daily net call premium by
    $10,000.

    The resulting net premium from both of these trades would be $5000 (+ $15,000 - $10,000).

    Transactions taking place at the mid are not accounted for.

    In theory:

    The sentiment in the options market becomes increasingly bullish if:
    1. The aggregated CALL PREMIUM is increasing at a faster rate.
    2. The aggregated PUT PREMIUM is decreasing at a faster rate.
